## Setup

### Prerequisites

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). The version specified in [`.nvmrc`](../.nvmrc) is guaranteed to work, but newer versions will likely work too.

Install Yarn: `npm i -g yarn`

### Project setup

Fork the **just** repo from [https://github.com/microsoft/just](https://github.com/microsoft/just), then clone your fork.

```bash
git clone <your-clone-url>
cd just
```

## Local development

### Install and build

```bash
$ yarn
$ yarn build
```

To run this with Node:

```bash
$ yarn start
```

To run tests and/or lint:

```bash
$ yarn test
$ yarn lint
